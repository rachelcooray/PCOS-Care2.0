                    <p>PCOS is a common condition that affects many individuals worldwide, but many people are still
                        undiagnosed. Its symptoms can often be easy to overlook, making it challenging for people to
                        seek the help they need. In this section, we highlight how widespread PCOS is in the population
                        and why it's so important to raise awareness. Understanding how common it is helps spread the
                        word about PCOS and encourages early diagnosis and treatment, leading to better care and
                        management.</p>

                        important to recognize these signs, as they can help people seek the right treatment. Lifestyle
